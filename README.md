# Matplotlib-Challenge
Matplotlib is a valuable tool used by data analysts to convert raw data, that’s been, “cleaned”, to represent trends and results in a visual, easily understandable way. 
These visual tools such as Bar & Pie Charts and scatter plots also allow us to estimate certain mathematical characteristics of given data such as the correlation coefficient and linear regression. 
In this case, the purpose of the study and given data was to study Capomulin, an experimental drug treating squamous cell carcinoma and the statistical effectiveness compared to other drugs with the same goal. 
Pymaceuticals Inc. is relying on our expertise to come to concrete conclusions about the drugs using our skills in dependencies, coding, (language=python), pandas, NumPy and a high-level understanding 
of statistics. For example, a conclusion that is clear from our cleaning of the dataset:

-The linea regression that occurs between mouse weight (the independent variable) and the average tumor volume (the dependent variable) as seen in the scatter plot at line 97 in the final report. 

Other important tools that matplotlib allows data scientists to use that were applicable in this project include:

-Pie Charts, where we were able to represent the amount of male versus female mice in a simplistic manner. 

-Boxplots which tell us if there are any possible outliers for specific treatments (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin). Capomulin and Ramicane possessed possible outliers while the other drugs did not.
